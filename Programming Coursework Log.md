# Programming Coursework Log

### Day 1 - 30/03/20

#### 12:25 am:

Created the GitLab project to start the work on the coursework. The most up-to-date edited code of the game will be stored in this repository for all to view. Added Julien Kunkel and Mohammed Al-Khafajiy to this repository as a developers so that they can view my repository as its being updated.

#### 8:12 pm:

Changed the title of the game to Mineplex Maze and edited this within the game's coding.

### Day 2 - 31/03/20

#### 11:35 pm:

Found and used this website, https://www.parallelrealities.co.uk/tutorials/ppp/ppp5.php, to help make the additions and changes to the game as necessary. I managed to change the movement controls (keyboard keys) of the character from a,d,i to LEFT, RIGHT and UP. I assigned LEFT to move character left, RIGHT to move character right and UP to make the character jump when it's on the ground.

### Day 3 - 01/04/20

#### 10:33 pm: 

I made a start on the LaTeX report of the project. Day 2 and 3's changes to the code have to uploaded to the project repository.

### Day 4 - 04/04/20

#### 11:46 pm:

I made changes to the graphics of the game to fit the title of the game I have decided upon. The tile blocks were changed to mineral ores you would find in a cave and I changed the items to collect in the game from pizzas to being diamonds.

### Day 5 - 06/04/20

#### 12:33 am:

I made changes to the graphics of the characters of the game.

### Day 6 - 07/04/20

#### 12:13 am:

Attempted to add the timer to the game, but have only managed to write the full screen text saying "TIME TAKEN".

### Day 7 - 09/04/20

#### 12:00 am:

Created new .c file named title.c, where I have added code for the title screen of the game. Currently, it does not work yet, but will get it working soon. Will work on the timer soon.
